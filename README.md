# Asteroids
Asteroids is a game that mimics the classic Arcade game using javascript, it is implemented mostly with functional programming and it runs on the browser. To play the game, simply double click the Asteroids.html file. 

## Description of the game
The goal is to shoot down as many asteroids before the ship life runs out. The instructions for controls are written on the right side of the game screen, have fun!

## Learning outcomes
From this game, I learned functional programming concepts and how to apply them in making a simple game.
